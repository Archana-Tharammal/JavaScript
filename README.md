# Project Milestones

This document outlines the key milestones for the project, including expected completion dates. Adjustments may be made based on specific semester requirements.

| **Milestone**                             | **Description**                                                 | **Expected Completion Date** |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **1. Project Proposal Submission**        | Finalize and submit the project proposal outlining objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. | Week 2                       |
| **2. Literature Review**                  | Conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature related to heart disease prediction and ECG classification techniques. | Week 4                       |
| **3. Data Acquisition**                   | Gather datasets from Kaggle, including the Heart Statlog and ECG Images datasets, ensuring they are downloaded and properly formatted. | Week 5                       |
| **4. Data Preprocessing**                 | Clean, preprocess, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on both datasets. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing data for model input. | Week 7                       |
| **5. Model Selection**                    | Research and select appropriate machine learning models for heart disease prediction and ECG classification, such as logistic regression and CNN. | Week 8                       |
| **6. Model Development**                  | Implement and train the selected models using the preprocessed data, and evaluate their performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.). | Week 10                      |
| **7. Comparative Analysis**               | Analyze the performance of different models, compare results, and refine models based on findings. | Week 11                      |
| **8. Final Report Draft**                 | Compile all findings, methodologies, and results into a final report draft for review and feedback. | Week 12                      |
| **9. Presentation Preparation**           | Create a presentation summarizing the project, including key findings, challenges faced, and future work. | Week 13                      |
| **10. Final Submission**                  | Submit the final report and presentation. Ensure all documentation is complete and properly formatted. | Week 14                      |

### Additional Notes
- **Adjust Dates**: Modify the expected completion dates based on your specific semester calendar and workload.
- **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule regular check-in meetings with your advisor or project group to discuss progress and address any challenges.
- **Flexibility**: Be prepared to adjust the timeline based on unforeseen circumstances or additional insights gained during the project.
